### 1.	Overview of Election Audit

For this project we assisted Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. After the votes were counted, we generated a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race. 
The objective is to automate the process for getting the report using Python because If this audit is done successfully, the code will be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections.
To deliver our report, we made a Python script that delivers the following data:
* Total number of votes cast
*Total number of votes each candidate received
*Percentage of votes for each candidate 
*The winner of the election based on popular vote
*Total votes cast by county
*Percentage of votes for each county
*The largest county turnout
